# team-profile-generator

## Description

This project is to complete the challenge for module 10, Object Oriented Programing, in the GA Tech Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I have created a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML file for a webpage that displays summaries for each person.


## Usage

To use the application, open the directory with this code in it, and, in the terminal, type the command `node index.js`. It is important to have Node.js installed, as well as the Inquirer npm for the command line prompts, and the Jest npm for testing.


## Installation

To install dependencies used with this code, type the command `npm install` in the terminal while in the directory with the index.js file.
